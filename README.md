# OKdplyr

The goal of Zero Kelvin dplyr is to extend some of the basic utilities from the tidyverse for specific uses and to maintain a store of the tools I have found useful in my work.  The modeling tools are mostly motivated by things that are easier to do in other languages like Python.  Extra dplyr is an extensions of tools from the tidyverse. Other miscellaneous utilities are also collected here for ease of use. 

The plan is for this package to continue growing as a general purpose repository of useful tools and functionality.

# OKdplyr

The goal of OKdplyr is to extend some of the basic utilities from the tidyverse for specific uses and to maintain a store of the tools I have found useful in my work.  Some of the functionality (like modeling tools) are motivated by things that are easier to do in other languages like Python.

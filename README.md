# OKdplyr

The goal of Zero Kelvin dplyr is to extend some of the basic utilities from the tidyverse for specific uses and to maintain a store of the tools I have found useful in my work.  Some of the functionality (like modeling tools) are motivated by things that are easier to do in other languages like Python. Other tools (like diversity) are updated implementations of past work. The plan is for this package to continue growing a general purpose repository of useful tools and functionality.
